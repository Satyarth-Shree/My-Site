# Hi — I'm Satyarth Shree

- I'm a BTech student in Robotics and Automation at Lovely Professional University (LPU), India.  
- I use this site as my main space to document what I'm learning, building, and exploring as I grow into an engineer.

I regularly write about my experiences, lessons, and technical concepts through blogs. If you're interested in following my journey, you can also read my posts on [Medium](https://medium.com/@satyarthshree45).

If you enjoy thoughtful technical writing or learning alongside someone actively exploring engineering — feel free to bookmark this site as this is now my main writing platform.

## Current Areas of Interest

Right now, I’m mainly focused on:

- Robotics concepts and ROS
- Mathematical ideas and intuitive understanding
- Programming with Python, C, and C++
- Writing tutorial-style blogs to reinforce and share what I learn
