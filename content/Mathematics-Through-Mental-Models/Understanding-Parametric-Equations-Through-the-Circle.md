# About The Article

In this article I will explain what I understood about parametric form while exploring equation of a circle.

Functions were defined by mathematicians because it is a mental model which elegantly explained mathematical equations like $y=f(x)$ where one $x$ gives only one $y$ . However not all equations were fit into this mental model. Equations like that of a circle do not obey the definitions of function. The general equation of a circle is as follows:

$$(x-h)^2 \, + \, (y-k)^2 \, = \, r^2 $$

For one value of x there were two values of y. Since this equation is not a function so the properties of functions cannot be applied on this equation. To explain these equations which do not fit into the mental model of a function a new concept named Parametric form was introduced. 
According to this new concept instead of explaining an equation as an input output model we will define it by how they are formed. 

Consider for example parametric form of the circle. It is as follows:

$$x = h \, +r\cos\theta, \; y= k \, +r\sin\theta$$

So here parametric form is basically telling us how x and y will be changing with respect to a third variable "$\theta$". If you try to think deeply then you will realize that these two equations are basically telling a story. A story which tells how a point having x and y as coordinates if moving in free space. 

Try to imagine what I am going to tell you now.
Take a good look at the general equation of a circle which is:

$$(x-h)^2 \; + (y-k)^2 \; = r^2$$

This center of this circle is $(h,k)$. Imagine a point $(h,k)$ has been marked with a dot. This dot is the center of this circle. Now in the parametric form carefully read the expression of x and y which is:

$$x=h \, + r\cos\theta, \; y = k \, +r\sin\theta$$

Now put $\theta = 0$ and you will get $x=h+r$ and $y=k$ which is the **right most point of circle.**
Put $\theta = \pi/2$ and you will get $x=h$ and $y = k+r$ which is the **topmost point of our circle.**
Now notice carefully as $\theta$ increases from $0 \; to \; \pi/2$ , x decreases from $h + r$ to $h$ and y increases from $k$ to $k + r$. This is the reason why a curve is formed. The x coordinates of points on this curve decrease when you move from left to right while the y coordinates increase.

Therefore we are defining how this curve is forming because of the parametric form. This is the beauty of this concept. It tells us how the formation of a curve takes place by telling us how x and y are changing. When we change the value of $\theta$ from $0 \; to \; 2\pi$ and analyze how x and y are changing in each interval we can form the entire circle.
