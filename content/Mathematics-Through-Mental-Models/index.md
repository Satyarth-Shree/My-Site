# Mathematics Through Mental Models

Mathematics is often taught through definitions, theorems, and formal procedures. While this structure is important, my own learning process relies heavily on **mental models** — intuitive frameworks that help me understand what mathematical ideas are really doing.

This section collects the conceptual models I build while learning mathematics. These models are not meant to replace formal theory; instead, they act as bridges between intuition and rigor.

## What you will find here

Rather than textbook-style explanations, these notes explore:

- Intuitive ways of understanding mathematical concepts  
- Internal pictures or stories that make abstract ideas clearer  
- Alternative perspectives on familiar structures  
- Personal interpretations that turn formulas into meaning

The focus is usually on *why* an idea makes sense conceptually rather than formal derivations.

## A note on accuracy and intention

These mental models prioritize understanding over historical or technical completeness. They are not authoritative references or formal proofs.

Some details may be simplified or interpreted differently from traditional treatments. The aim is conceptual clarity. For rigorous definitions and formal theory, textbooks and academic sources remain essential.

## Why mental models?

Mental models help shift mathematics from memorization toward visualization and reasoning. They allow us to:

- Recognize patterns instead of isolated formulas  
- Understand relationships between concepts  
- Think about structures dynamically

For example, a parametric equation can be seen not just as a formula, but as a description of how a point moves through space.

## Who this is for

- Students seeking intuitive understanding alongside formal study  
- Learners who prefer conceptual explanations before symbolic rigor  
- Anyone interested in understanding mathematics through internal frameworks

This section evolves alongside my learning journey. Each entry reflects how I currently understand a concept, and those understandings may change over time.
